## Prerequisites

To use Prisma Pulse, you need to meet the following prerequisites:

- A GitHub account.
- Pulse requires [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client) version `4.16.1` or higher and [`@prisma/extension-pulse`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/extension-pulse) version `v0.2.3` or higher.
- A publicly accessible PostgreSQL database.
- For the [**Starter Plan**](https://www.prisma.io/pricing): Ability to use the superuser account of the database instance.

You will also need a database with the following configurations:

- PostgreSQL version 12+.
- Ensure your database is publicly accessible.
- [Set the `wal_level` setting in PostgreSQL to `logical`](/pulse/getting-started#wal_level).

## 1. Database setup

### General database configuration

#### Required settings

##### [<inlinecode id="wal_level">wal_level</inlinecode>](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html)

Some providers may not allow direct access to this setting. If you are unable to change this setting, please refer to the provider-specific guides for further assistance.

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical;
```

You will need to restart the database after changing this setting.

#### Optional settings

The following increases the memory usage of the [write-ahead log](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html) on your PostgreSQL database. We suggest setting these values initially and adjusting them if necessary.

##### <inlinecode>[max_replication_slots](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html)</inlinecode>

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_replication_slots = 20;
```

##### <inlinecode>[wal_keep_size](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html)</inlinecode>

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_keep_size = 2048;
```

##### Configuring replication slots and publications

When using Prisma Pulse with a database that permits superuser access, it will handle the management of logical replication slots automatically.

When Prisma Pulse is enabled, by default, it creates a logical replication slot enabled for all tables, which is removed automatically when Prisma Pulse is disabled.

If you want to enable replication for _specific models_ or use a database provider that restricts superuser access for Prisma Pulse, you must manually create and submit your replication slot before activating Prisma Pulse.

Our **paid plan** users can provide a **logical replication slot name** and a **publication name**.

1. Create a logical replication slot:

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('$REPLICATION_SLOT_NAME', 'pgoutput');
```

Learn more [here](https://pgpedia.info/p/pg_create_logical_replication_slot.html).

2. View your logical replication slots:

```sql
SELECT slot_name, slot_type FROM pg_replication_slots WHERE slot_type = 'logical';
```

3. You can create publications in the following ways below depending on the version of your PostgreSQL database.

   - Publication for all models:

     ```sql
     CREATE PUBLICATION $PUBLICATION_NAME FOR ALL TABLES;
     ```

   - Publication for specific models. For example, create a publication that publishes all changes in two tables:

     ```sql
     CREATE PUBLICATION user_and_department_publication FOR TABLE users, departments;
     ```

   - Publication for a model with a `WHERE` clause on it’s fields. For example, create a publication that publishes all changes from active `departments`:

     ```sql
     CREATE PUBLICATION active_departments FOR TABLE departments WHERE (active IS TRUE);
     ```

   - Publication for specific fields. For example, create a publication that publishes all changes for table `users`, but replicates only columns `user_id` and `firstname`:

     ```sql
     CREATE PUBLICATION users_filtered FOR TABLE users (user_id, firstname);
     ```

   - Publication based on DML operations. For example, create a publication that only publishes `INSERT` operations in one table:

     ```sql
     CREATE PUBLICATION insert_only FOR TABLE departments
       WITH (publish = 'insert');
     ```

     > `publish` (`string`)
     >
     > This parameter determines which DML operations will be published by the new publication to the subscribers. The value is comma-separated list of operations. The allowed operations are `insert`, `update`, `delete`, and `truncate`. The default is to publish all actions, and so the default value for this option is `'insert, update, delete, truncate'`.

     You can learn more about the PostgreSQL's `CREATE PUBLICATION`, supported versions and see more examples [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpublication.html).

4. Then you can submit the replication slot name and the publication slot name in the Platform console, before enabling Prisma Pulse:
   ![](./images/replication-slot-submission.png)

##### Removing replication slots and publications

If you are managing your replication slots and publications independently and opt to disable Prisma Pulse for a particular environment, you can refer to the following SQL queries.

1. View your replication slots:

```sql
SELECT FROM pg_replication_slots;
```

2. To delete a replication slot:

```sql
SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot(slot_name) FROM pg_replication_slots WHERE slot_name = '$REPLICATION_SLOT_NAME';
```

> ℹ️ An active replication slot cannot be deleted, please ensure you’ve disabled Prisma Pulse before you’re attempting to delete the replication slot.

3. To delete a publication slot:

```sql
DROP PUBLICATION IF EXISTS "$PUBLICATION_SLOT_NAME";
```

### Provider specific configuration

Database provider specific configurations for Prisma Pulse are provided below.

#### Railway

[Railway.app](https://railway.app) offers an excellent [templates feature](https://railway.app/templates). If you wish to quickly start with Prisma Pulse, you can use either of two templates:

- [Prisma Pulse DB Only](https://railway.app/template/pulse-pg): Provides a fresh, pre-configured PostgreSQL database which you can use with Prisma Pulse.
- [Prisma Pulse DB & App](https://railway.app/template/pulse-starter): Provides a pre-configured PostgreSQL database and a [Prisma Pulse starter app](https://github.com/prisma/pulse-starter).

##### Setup without using a template

<details><summary>1. Change the PostgreSQL database settings</summary>

You can run these queries in the Railway Database **Query** tab, using the [railway cli](https://docs.railway.app/databases/postgresql), or any other way you might run queries on your database.

1. Set the <inlinecode>[wal_level](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html)</inlinecode> to `logical`:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical;
```

2. Set the <inlinecode>[max_replication_slots](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html)</inlinecode> to `20`:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_replication_slots = 20;
```

3. Set the <inlinecode>[wal_keep_size](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html)</inlinecode> to `2048`:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_keep_size = 2048;
```

4. Reload the PostgreSQL configuration:

```sql
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>2. Restart your database</summary>

1. Click on your database.

2. Navigate to the Deployments tab.

3. Go into the three-dots menu on the latest deployment and click the `Restart` option.

</details>

After setting up your Railway database, you have to use the [connection string](https://docs.railway.app/guides/postgresql#tcp-proxy-connection) provided by Railway that allows public access your PostgreSQL database.

#### Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL

You have to enable logical replication on AWS RDS to make it compatible with Prisma Pulse.

The following instructions show how to create a parameter group, enable logical replication, and add the parameter group to your AWS RDS PostgreSQL database.

1. Create a parameter group for your RDS database (`RDS` > `Parameter groups` > `Create a parameter group`). In the **Parameter group family**, select your Postgres version. Select the type **DB Parameter group** option and assign a descriptive group name and description:

![Create a parameter group in AWS RDS](./images/aws-rds-create-parameter-group.png)

2. Set the `rds.logical_replication` parameter to `1`(`true`) in the parameter group.

![Set logical replication parameter group](./images/set-logical-replication-parameter.png)

3. Modify **Database options** (`RDS` > `Databases` > `Modify`) to use the new DB parameter group:

![Add Parameter group to AWS RDS](./images/add-group.png)

To reflect the configuration change into `wal_level`, select the **Apply immediately** option.

4. Go to `RDS` > `Databases` > `[database name]`, then click on **Actions**, and then click on **Reboot** to restart your database.

#### Supabase

You have to use a direct database connection from Supabase to use it with Prisma Pulse.

To use a direct database connection string in Supabase:

1. Navigate to your Project settings (`Settings` > `Configurations` > `Database`).
2. Disable the **Use connection pooling** option.
   ![Supabase direct database connection](./images/supabase-direct-database-connection.png)
3. Copy the direct database connection string.

<Admonition type="info">

ℹ️ Prisma Pulse is currently incompatible with Supabase's connection pooler. This results from the connection pooler intercepting the connection between your database and Prisma Pulse and removing the [Streaming Replication Protocol](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-replication.html#PROTOCOL-REPLICATION) which is used by Prisma Pulse to transmit replication commands to the database.

</Admonition>

## 2. Enable Pulse in a project

Log into the [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io/login), create a new project and enable Prisma Pulse in an environment.

> An API key will be created after you enable and setup Prisma Pulse in your [environment](/platform/concepts/environments).

## 3. Use Pulse in your application

<Admonition type="info">

We have created an [example repository](https://github.com/prisma/pulse-starter) on GitHub to help you get started using Prisma Pulse. If you would like to start there, you can do so.

</Admonition>

The following will show how you can utilize Prisma Pulse in an existing application. We will be adding Prisma Pulse to the [hello-prisma](/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases-typescript-postgresql) example from our documentation.

### 3.1. Install the Pulse Prisma Client extension

In a project using [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client), run the following command to install the Pulse extension:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/extension-pulse
```

#### Store your Pulse API key in your .env file

The Prisma Pulse extension requires you to use an API key.

<Admonition type="info">

You should have received an API key when you added Prisma Pulse to your environment in the Platform Console.

</Admonition>

In `.env`, add a variable named `PULSE_API_KEY`:

```env file=.env
PULSE_API_KEY="YOUR-API-KEY"

# Example:
# PULSE_API_KEY="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhcGlfa2V5IjoiNGMxNzM0MGItMmFhYy00MGMxLWE1ZDctNzYyNmRjNjg3NjM4IiwidGVuYW50X2lkIjoiY2VhZjE0NThkZGUyYzJmNTU0ZmNkNTI2MmFmOWY1ODljMWJiZmRhNDU0N2UxMjM1ODk3MGQ2MGI1ZjRlNTU0OCIsImludGVybmFsX3NlY3JldCI6ImM1ZTcxYjJhLTE0NzdawdwDliZS1hM2IzLTczODFkNDM5ZmEwZSJ9.wCUlghC_suFBr2vnk0q_5I8iRNRDyEQo0W9rnhf6mCw"
```

### 3.2. Create a Pulse-enabled Prisma Client

To use Prisma Pulse, you must extend Prisma Client with the Prisma Pulse extension.
Add the following to extend your existing Prisma Client instance with the Prisma Pulse extension:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withPulse } from '@prisma/extension-pulse'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
  withPulse({ apiKey: process.env.PULSE_API_KEY })
)
```

### 3.3. Create your first Pulse subscription

With the Prisma Pulse extension applied, you may now use Prisma Pulse's `subscribe()` method on any model defined in your Prisma Schema to subscribe to data change events.

In the example below, a subscription is made on a `user` table that listens for _any_ change event on that table:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withPulse({ apiKey: apiKey }))

async function main() {
  const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe({})

  if (subscription instanceof Error) {
    throw subscription
  }

  // Example: Set a timeout to the subscription after 60 seconds.
  // Explicitly stopping the subscriptions and closing the connection is needed
  // to not exhaust the limited number of subscriptions allowed per table.

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Stopping the subscription.')
    subscription.stop()
  }, 60000)

  for await (const event of subscription) {
    console.log('just received an event:', event)
  }
}

main()
```
